comments:

pay closer to error messages or any other info given, what can you find out about format!!
always look for base64 values in pcaps ig lol
tcpstream pcaps to read better, either in wireshark or use script
test things out, especially if you have example requests try them yourself with exact copy!
headers can affect request output, so don't be lazy and add ones you think relevant
look closer again at what info you have on backend, especially debug messages!!
from writeup, sqlmap would've worked if randomized id rip, massage request so best chance for sqlmap
