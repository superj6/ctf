comments:

curl -v command can give extra info about connection, including tls version
always find and check relevant config files for passwords, especially ones pointed at dummy!!
then check passwords and see if resued in different contexts, especially admin passes
may have to modify connections such as ssh due to old versions or weird handshakes
