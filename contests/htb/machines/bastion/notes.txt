comments:

port 445 - always enumerate smb!!
look up any file types u don't know when enumerating, use intuition think what they hold
vhd files are windows disks, can mount remote file system then guestmount vhd file
when have full access to file system, grab hashes to crack from SAM/SYSTEM
look at program files and similar locations that may have installed vulnerable programs!
always think if other programs may store passwords somewhere
%appdata% good location in general to check on windows
main windows pass locations are sam or AD
