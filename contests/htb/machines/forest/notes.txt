comments:

learn/use windows enumeration tools at beginning of windows boxes - enum4linux!
ldapsearch works like grep to narrow down what it returns with -b
make sure you aren't missing users defined different ways, if stuck look at all groups!
look for windows kerberos password hashes with getnpusers script
if evil-winrm not working edit /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf
windows remote file transfer with wget -UseBasicParsing, and specify output file!
if not work use inbuilt evil-winrm download (slower)
add bin path to sudo with /etc/sudoers safe_path
windows OS "(Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion").ReleaseId"
use smbserver to move file from remote to local
use powersploit module for more commands
import module by "powershell.exe -ep bypass" then ". .\module.ps1"
create new user to try to mitigate scripts that affect current users
use bloodhound to look for acl exploit paths, maybe can use aclpwn to auto exploit
