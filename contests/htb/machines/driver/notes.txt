ricoh pcl6 driver exploit - ricoh_exploit but not work so just msf

alternate privesc exploit

comments:

make guesses on what back end contains, are there keywords hints eg "using share"
from backend function guess, make broad google searches to try to find exploit path
look carefully through winpeas output, look at all sus files, do they give direction hints?!
use "x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc-win32" to compile exe on linux
lookup errors quicker and get fix
just use msfconsole when stuff not working
msfconsole can automatic look up exploits with "post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester"
look even more carefully at winpeas, maybe multiple exploit paths
can look up exploits with searchsploit (exploitdb), add them to metasploit modules
