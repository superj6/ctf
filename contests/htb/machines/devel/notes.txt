comments:

test what reasonable capabilities are possible with what you have, especially when stuck - ftp put!
when find capability, further analyze what it can execute/interact with - run aspx files!
search all versions of everything relevant to see if exploitable - windows 7 build!
many ways to file upload to windows on rshell, but make sure it not distort - ftp binary!
compile for windows with gcc-mingw!
