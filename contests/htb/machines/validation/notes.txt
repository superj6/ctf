write php rshell in /var/www/html/, also use sqlmap --file-write --file-dest

comments:

don't over rely on tools, do things by hand when you know how
think how any known file write capability can be used, make your own page with rshell!
don't forget to try stupid things like reuse password!
sqlmap set level/param when not working, and make rshell by hand
