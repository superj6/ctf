comments:

nmap can use -Pn if things aren't showing up
look up versions for all relevant things used as always - nostromo
wrap command for rshell in bash -c "cmd" or similar when not working
always look up server config files once rhshell, try to find db passwords and misconfigurations
pay more attention to config files, do you actually understand all the settings?!
never assume promising way is correct, the more stuck the more consider other paths still!!
look up or think about what commands you run are using, can you exploit those - journalctl!
instead of trying to replace command, try to see what command can do - less pager!
