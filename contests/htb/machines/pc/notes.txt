comments:

every form has chance to be some type of injection!
once again image different ways could be built in backend, think maybe different than u know
look up what are possible different technologies for backend too to get ideas
think how you can redirect input to reuse tools you know - grpcui => burp => sqlmap!
always check ports available when get rshell, more services may be available - netstat -tnlp
