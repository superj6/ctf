comments:

url encode commands that may be distorted, try wrapping in things like "bash -c" to fix env
apache web server (and maybe any) always under /var/www/
config database setup info likely under /local directory
try to find user passwords in config setups of website and other programs/services reused
look at config files for webserver architecture (or any running program)
check if can bypass programs by editting them you clown
ssh tunnel "-L" port forward external machine locally
ssh keys can be encrypted, unencrypt with john
try taking passwords lists like rockyou and lowering down with hint for brute
apparently hack reverse shell can mess up sudo (or other capabilities) where ssh works
