connect to ssh with private key

comments:

nmap run --scripts vuln
don't for sslscan for https
use searchsploit smh
make sure look at multiple vulns and try all/see which fits best!
add ssh options to use private key
copy over ssh with scp
always look at bash_history and any other non-empty in /home
